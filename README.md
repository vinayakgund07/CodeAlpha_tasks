# 📊 CodeAlpha - Data Visualization Project  
**Task 3 – Data Analytics Internship**

This project transforms raw web-scraped book data into meaningful visual insights using **Python**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

The dataset used here (`books_dataset.csv`) was generated in **Task 1: Web Scraping**.

---

## 📁 Dataset  
`books_dataset.csv` contains:

- **Book Title**
- **Price**

Prices originally contained symbols like (£, Rs, RS).  
These were cleaned and converted into numeric format for visualization.

- 20–40  
- 40–60  
- 60–80  
- 80–100
